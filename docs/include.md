## Including CGL (After Installation) and making a main loop

To **include** CGL in your C++ project you will use  
```cpp
#include <cgl.hpp>

int main() {
  // Everything else goes inside the main loop
}
```
  
This will **include** the cgl.hpp which has all the other header files in it.  
This makes it so you won't have to include multiple different .hpp files for your project.
