# CGL To Do

> [!NOTE]  
> This list includes many features and fixes that are currently planned for CGL  
> A feature being on this list does not mean that is concrete to come at somepoint, escpecially the near future  
> However as a single developer I hope to add everything on this list eventually, but can't promise anything.


## Feature List

- Image Loading
- Textures
- Basic Physics

- Better debugging (Working on it slowly, but surely as I go on)
